// publicStatusForCategory maps an error category to the HTTP status a client
// should see. It sits beside messageForCategory so the status and the text a
// client receives cannot disagree about what went wrong.
//
// The statuses follow the convention an OpenAI-compatible client already acts on:
// 429 is where it looks for a retryable capacity problem (and for a quota, where
// it stops), 401 for a credential it must replace, 400 for a request the upstream
// rejected on its merits, and 5xx for the gateway's or the upstream's own fault.
//
// Two categories carry the same numeric status for different reasons, which is
// why the table entries are not collapsed:
//
//   - upstream_queue is a throttle the caller can wait out: the upstream put the
//     request in a queue and named a window. It is answered as 429 + Retry-After
//     so an OpenAI-compatible client backs off and comes back, instead of reading
//     503 as a broken gateway.
//   - upstream_unavailable is the upstream's own service being down for this
//     model with no window offered. It is not the caller's rate limit and not
//     this gateway's fault, so it is answered as a temporarily unavailable
//     upstream rather than as a 429 that tells the caller to stop sending.
